# PomodoroTimer
I have always been an advocate of high efficiency and high productivity. This is my first side project: Pomodoro timer (or tomato timer).\
Pomodoro Timer is a productivity interval that gives 25 minutes of work followed by a 5-minutes break. After 4 interval, you get a 15-minute break.\
I want to create a webapp that have the basic functionality of Pomodoro Timer and some added features. For example, if someone is in their zone and the working interval ended, I want there to be an overtime button where the amount that they worked for overtime will be added to the long break, or the working time is deducted in the next interval. Also, I want to implement a functionality where the user enter the amount of time they want to work for, and my webapp will show the most appropriate working and resting intervals.
test.
